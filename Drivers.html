                  He hasn’t as many victories or WRC championships as the other
                  Seb, but the ones he has achieved have arguably been even more
                  richly deserved. As soon as he went toe-to-toe with Loeb at
                  Citroen it was clear Ogier was the real deal, and he remains
                  one of the few to beat the elder Frenchman in a straight fight
                  in equal machinery. Blisteringly quick on every surface and
                  possessed of an uncanny ability to look after his tyres even
                  when setting fastest times, Ogier also has a ferocious work
                  ethic that leaves no stone unturned in the pursuit of
                  perfection. Titles in the all-conquering Volkswagen Polo were
                  expected, but his two crowns won in the private M-Sport Ford
                  Fiesta against the factory might of Hyundai and Toyota best
                  demonstrate the abilities of his exceptional talent. Perhaps
                  more worryingly for the competition is the fact he’s not quite
                  finished yet. Yes, 2021 will be his last year before
                  retirement, but it’d be a brave person that best against him
                  leaving with an eighth crown perched on his head.

                <p>
                  For many, Rohrl is the ‘drivers’ driver, his blend of raw
                  driving talent an intellectual nous making him a formidable
                  opponent regardless of surface or car. His 14 wins and two
                  world titles speak for themselves, but you have to dig a
                  little deeper to unearth the real genius. For example, he
                  notched up three consecutive Monte Carlo Rally wins with three
                  very different cars (rear-drive Opel Ascona, mid-engined
                  Lancia 037 and turbocharged four-wheel drive Audi Quattro). He
                  was also the only driver able to wrestle the fearsome,
                  fire-breathing S1 Quattro to a win (Sanremo 1985). His
                  versatility also saw him take class wins at the Le Mans 24
                  hours, a win at Pikes Peak and race victories for Audi in the
                  DTM and IMSA series. So why doesn’t he finish higher? Well,
                  for all his talent Rohrl chose to skip events he felt were too
                  specialised or required too much local knowledge, such as the
                  1000 Lakes in Finland and the RAC in the UK.

                  There would be a strong argument for placing Juha at the top
                  of this list, but his weakness on Tarmac (he never won a
                  sealed surface WRC event) just counts against him. The list of
                  four championships with three manufacturers is impressive
                  enough, as are the 25 wins. Yet it’s the fact he secured
                  victories in Group B, Group A and WRC machinery that really
                  marks the moustachioed maestro out as something special - few
                  drivers are as versatile. Not always the outright fastest (and
                  curiously for a Finn he rarely braked with his left foot),
                  Kankunnen’s silky smooth style, mechanical sympathy and cool
                  head meant he was always in the right place at the right time,
                  ready to pressure rivals into a mistake and quickly pounce to
                  take advantage. Whether it’s in a Peugeot 205 T16, any number
                  of Lancia Deltas or a Subaru Impreza WRC, Kankunnen’s legacy
                  as an all-time great is assured.

                  In raw statistical terms there’s no denying Loeb is one of the
                  greatest. Most rally wins? Check. Most world titles? Check.
                  Most stage wins? Again, check. Known as Le Patron (The Boss),
                  Loeb's speed and talent are unquestioned, with an uncanny
                  ability to consistently drive to the very outer envelope of
                  his incredibly high limits, but very rarely step over them.
                  One of the few non Scandinavians to conquer the Finnish and
                  Swedish rallies, he’s also got a Le Mans podium, WTCC wins and
                  remarkable record-breaking Pikes Peak run to his name. He’s
                  also the only person to win every stage of a WRC rally
                  (Corsica 2005). He also performed some of the most stunning
                  comebacks, such as the spell-binding charge to second on the
                  2006 Monte Carlo after sliding off the road and down the order
                  on the first day. So why is his name not at the top? Well, all
                  those WRC records were garnered with a big-spending Citroen
                  team in its pomp, while the later titles were captured when
                  the competition had waned, with very few top flight rivals or
                  teams.

                  Arguably the most famous rally driver of them all, McRae was
                  also one of the fastest - and undoubtedly the most
                  spectacular. Whether it was the early days in his Vauxhall
                  Nova, or the later Subaru and Ford years, Colin’s car control
                  and commitment were something to be savoure. Oozing natural
                  talent, the Scot was capable of stage times so paralysingly
                  fast that rivals were often left in open-mouthed
                  incomprehension. Yet this other worldly turn of speed also
                  came with a propensity to push just a little too hard, with
                  potential wins and titles being lost in the aftermath of an
                  over ambitious corner entry speed. McRae was mechanically
                  sympathetic (multiple wins on the Safari and Acropolis prove
                  that), but he wasn’t quite able to tame the urge to push just
                  that bit too hard in pursuit of an even faster stage time.
                  Ultimately, it was the later generation of WRC cars that did
                  for Colin, their neat-and-tidy approach never really suiting
                  his sideways style, and so he bowed out of the WRC full-time
                  at the end of 2003 having endured his first winless season
                  since 1992.

                  Making his debut on the WRC debut in 1987, Sainz set the
                  template for the modern, professional rally driver. The
                  intense Spainard had a relentless determination to extract
                  every ounce of performance out of a car - while other drivers
                  would simply drive what was underneath them, Sainz would
                  evaluate every single tyre, spring and damper setting, before
                  going back to the beginning and doing it all again. His star
                  really began to rise when he joined Toyota in 1989, helping to
                  develop its ST165 Celica GT-4 into a winner. In the process he
                  became the first non-Scandinavian to win Finland’s 1000 Lakes
                  Rally in 1990, on the way to the first of his two world
                  titles. But for mechanical failures he could easily have added
                  three more crowns to that tally, while his pursuit of
                  perfection meant he was seeing off younger upstarts and still
                  winning rallies in 2004. A trio of Dakar rally wins since
                  retiring from the WRC in 2006 shows he has no intention of
                  slowing down.

                <p>
                  From 1996 until 1999 there was no stopping Tommi Makinen as he
                  steamrollered his way to four world titles on the trot in an
                  array of Mitsubishi Lancer Evolutions. Like Michael Schumacher
                  at Ferrari, the UK-based Ralliart team that developed and
                  prepared his cars was built around the Finn with the same
                  single-minded pursuit of all-out dominance. His rather digital
                  approach at the controls was at odds with virtuoso flair of
                  McRae, but the scintillating speed was undeniable. Of course
                  Tommi was quick in Finland, winning his home event four times,
                  but unlike many of his countrymen he was also fast on Tarmac,
                  taking four Monte Carlo wins as well as victories on the mixed
                  surface Sanremo. Like Loeb, however, Makinen’s claim to
                  all-time greatness is hampered by the fact that so much of his
                  success came with one manufacturer, with 22 of his 24 wins
                  secured in Mitsubishis. That said, with rivals that included
                  McRae, Sainz, Burns, Auriol and Kankkunen, none of those
                  victories came easy.

                  The Alain Prost to McRae’s Aryton Senna, the statistics don’t
                  really do justice to Burns’ incredible ability. At 22 he
                  became the the youngest ever British rally champ, while in
                  partnership with his co-driver, Robert Reid, he set new
                  standards for preparation and professionalism, his detailed
                  pace notes in particular allowing him to build up in his head
                  a 4K HDR picture of the stage ahead, a fact that was most
                  starkly illustrated on the 1997 RAC Rally. On an early 10-mile
                  run through Radnor - blanketed in a pea-souper of a fog that
                  reduced visibility to nothing - Richard’s Mitsubishi was a
                  full minute faster than McRae’s Subaru. He even caught and
                  passed a bewildered Didier Auriol in the middle of the stage
                  (the onboard footage showing the speed differential between
                  the two is mesmerising). The Reading driver was at his
                  imperious and stage-dominating best in various Subaru Impreza
                  WRCs, winning eight events and the world title between 1999
                  and 2001. Two years with Peugeot didn’t live up to the
                  promise, while a move back to Subaru in 2004 was cruelly
                  denied after being diagnosed with the brain tumour that
                  tragically cut his life short in 2005.

                  The first ever official driver’s world champion, Bjorn
                  Waldegaard was quick and consistent in everything he drove. He
                  also had a longer career than most, his immense talent
                  allowing him to keep winning when others had long since
                  retired. He made his mark in the Porsche 911, winning the 1969
                  Monte Carlo Rally, before taking further victories in
                  machinery as diverse as the howling Lancia Stratos, the iconic
                  Ford Escort MK2 and the lumbering Mercedes 500SLC. His last
                  win came in 1990, 21 years after the first, when he conquered
                  the gruelling Safari Rally in a Toyota Celica GT-4. In fact,
                  despite being brought up on the snow and gravel of his native
                  Sweden, Waldegaard was most at home in the dust of Africa,
                  with a total of four wins on the Safari and three on the Ivory
                  Coast. His love affair was so strong with the Continent that
                  he continued to compete in the East African Classic Safari
                  well into his sixties, winning the event outright in 2007 and
                  2011.
