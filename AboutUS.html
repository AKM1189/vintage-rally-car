            <h2>About Vintage Rally Club</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            The Vintage Rally Club was formed in 1934 by a group of five founder
            member to provide competitive events for cars five years old or more
            and social events for members’. Initially the age cut off for
            eligible cars was intended to be a rolling five years but this
            changed very quickly. In 1936 this was changed to any cars
            manufacturer prior to December 31st 1930 as the members felt this
            date marked a shift towards mass market sports car which were not
            desirable. Since then the Club has recognised Post Vintage
            Thouroughbreds which were manufactured later but still have the
            workmanship recognised as desirable. These designations were adopted
            by the governing body, then the Royal Automobile Club and are still
            in place today.

                "Historic rally events have real appeal; they are full of
                spirit, comradeship and enjoyment and that's my kind of
                lifestyle, I love going back in time and looking at all these
                cars from the passt and I'm really looking forward to being part
                of this very special atmosphere when I attend Rally the Globe
                events."

                thereafter, winning the epic Paris Dakar Rally no fewer than
                four times. With Fred Gallagher, he won the FIA World Cup for
                Cross-Country Rallies with Citroen Sport in 1997 and they also
