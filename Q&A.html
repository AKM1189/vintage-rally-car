			<button class="question"> Where can I find the timetable for a forthcoming event?</button>
			<div class="answer">
  				<p>
  					If you are competing or marshalling at an event the detailed timetable will be included in your Competitors' or Marshals' Instructions which are sent approximately ten days prior to the event taking place. Approximate timings will be published in the Club’s Newsletter in the months leading up to the event. Each individual Event page on the website will be updated with the timetable and latest information as it becomes available so check these pages regularly. Race meetings all follow a similar format with practice sessions in the morning from 9am, a lunch break of an hour followed by the races in the afternoon from 1pm. Similarly, Sprints and Hill Climbs will commence from 9am with two practice runs per competitor in Class order before lunch, followed by two Competitive Runs in the afternoon. These times are a guide and may be slightly different depending on the circuit/venue or event programme.

			<div class="answer">
  				<p>
  					Charging and refund policyWhen you enter an event the regulations will state the closing date for entries. If you withdraw prior to that date no charge for the event will be due, if you have paid in advance a full refund will be due.If you withdraw after the closing date but before 4pm on the Wednesday prior to the event, 50% of the entry fee will be due. If you paid in advance, then a refund of 50% of the entry fee will be due.If you withdraw after 4pm on the Wednesday prior to the event, or do not turn up at the event, or do not take part, your entry fee will still be the full amount. If you have paid in advance, no refund will be due.At race meetings, if you take part in one or more races but are unable to compete in all races entered then 50% of the entry fee for races you did not start will be due. If you paid in advance, then a refund of 50% of the entry fee for those races will be due. Consideration will be made for exceptional circumstances at the discretion of the Club Secretary.

			<button class="question"> How do I know if my entry has been received/accepted?</button>
			<div class="answer">
  				<p>
  					If you enter online you will receive an acknowledgment of your entry almost straight away by email to your registered email address. If you sent your entry form to the Office you will receive an acknowledgement by post within 7 days.Your entry acknowledgement will advise if your entry status is CONFIRMED or PENDING. The Regulations for each event will stipulate the percentage of the maximum entry which is allocated on a first come first served basis. If you are in this percentage your entry is CONFIRMED, which means you are guaranetted an entry for the event. If you are in the final number of entries and your confirmation email or card advises a PENDING status, this means that shoudl the event become over subscribed you will be subject to the VSCC selection process. Entries are selected as soon as possible after the closing date and acceptance of entry is confirmed by receipt of Competitors' Instructions (by Post for ticketed events such as Race Meetings or by Email for non-ticketed events such as Trials). If an event is oversubscribed, Rejections may need to be made - these will always be made by post at the earliest opportunity.

			<button class="question"> When and where are results published?</button>
			<div class="answer">
  				<p>
  					Results are published as soon as possible after an event weekend, usuall by midday on the following Monday. Once results are finalised they are uploaded to the web site. To find the results on-line go to the Events tab, find your event and click on teh results button.Remember by default only upcoming events are shown, so you will have to change the Year filter. Alternatively contact the Competition Department and we will be happy to email/post you a copy. For all Speed events (Sprints and Hill Climbs), Trials, Rallies and Driving Tests, results will remain Provisional for 7 days following publication, during which time competitors are within their rights to raise any queries with the Secretary of the Meeting. At the end of this period, Results are made Final and cannot be changed. At a Race Meeting, results remain Provisional for 30 minutes following the conclusion of each race, when a competitor can approach the event’s Clerk of the Course with any objection. The results for each race then become Final and a complete set of results are made available to download from this webpage as soon as possible.
